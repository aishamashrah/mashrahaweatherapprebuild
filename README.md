The app works well and meet all the requirements of the original assignment.  I really liked the design and color of the layouts. The code was done well but I would suggest instead of using setstates to save the information just pass the information straight into where they need to go using dot notation. This would save you a lot of lines of code. I would also suggest breaking your components up a little more, having one for your search bar, one for your main weather, and one for your forecast and passing in the information using dot notation into the components props. Everything was great I liked the organization of the code, it made it alot easier to read and follow what was going on.
